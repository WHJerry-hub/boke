# **Credit Card Approval Prediction**

In this project, we downloaded relevant data about credit card from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/data?select=credit_record.csv), first preprocessed the data, splited the target column (" risk "), then divided the data set into a balanced subset, and selected the model by balancing the dataset. Then the pre-processed dataset was divided into 5 sub-data sets with different imbalance proportions, and then the strategies of oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE sampling were adopted for each imbalance dataset, finally the sampled data set was evaluated on the selected model.
